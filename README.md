## DESCRIPTION
In this project,we use the programming language Python to: 
     * Create scripts that read, write, and store data from files or in arrays.
     * Perform mathematical operations.
     * Use decision statements, logical operations for complex comparisons, and repetition statements to run code more than once.
     * Produce screen outputs.

### SITUATION/TASK
A Colorado Board of Election employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

#### Challenge - ADDED TASK
The Election Commission has asked for further analsysis into the election data.

1. Calculate the voter turnout for each county that voted in the congressional district.
2. Calculate the percentage of votes each county contributed to the election.
2. Determine which county had the largest turnout.
